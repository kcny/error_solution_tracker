BugArchive

The Bug Archives is a tool that can be used to save all those cool debugging tricks that often times are hard to remember when under pressure.  You can save your error messages, solutions, and notes on how you were able to resolve a certain issue.  While the web is always a good option, there are times when it is just hard to find what you found a few weeks ago.  It might be esier to save in a place like BugArchive to help save time.
